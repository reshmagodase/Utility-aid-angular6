00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.200
When you run a charity, every penny counts

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.160
and we want to ensure that that is spent on people, not on bills.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.320
Utility Aid have saved us an immense amount,

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.400
over forty thousand pounds since 2011.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.760
That’s approximately £5000 of savings per year.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.080
We’re a national charity.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.760
Without Utility Aid we would not be able
to run our community hub in Teddington.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.400
It is extremely costly.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.960
We have been known to save up to
almost half of a customer's energy bill.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.120
Typically it will be 20-30%

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.160
which is a huge amount of cash coming back into the charity.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.640
It really is simple.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.200
All the customer needs to do is send us a bill,
together with a letter of authority.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.600
We send that information off to our suppliers.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.760
We pull all the information back.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.880
Collate the prices.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.520
Present them back to the customer.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.400
They choose which one they want to sign with.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.680
Before working with Utility Aid,

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.920
United Response had contracts with many providers.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.520
It was extremely messy.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.320
Utility Aid have streamlined these processes

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.600
and enabled us to save so much money.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.360
It means a lot to these guys.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.600
It gives them a purpose to come out during the day.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.840
I used to spend a lot of time indoors.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.720
Now I feel a lot more confident.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.680
I like to come here, have a
chat and have a cup of tea.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.000
We’re a caring company, in a caring sector.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.120
Part of our culture is to give back.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.760
Staff engage with the different charities

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.920
and they could be dog handling charities,
they could be care or for the elderly.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.360
Last year we won The Most Trusted Energy Broker of the Year.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.280
Everything we do, that’s the whole of our ethos, is care.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.800
Every single day we help charities save money

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.840
and we know every pound we save,

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.880
they push back into their own services.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.800
Nothing beats that.
