00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.720
I love all the volunteer events.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.480
I love all the fundraisers that we do.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.120
I think that people should come and work for Utility Aid

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.760
because we really do care.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.320
You get to speak to a lot of charities,

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.960
a lot of people who really need the help.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.760
We all want to do things. It’s a big team.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.280
We took part in Red August for a mental health charity.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.400
We ran every day.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.200
We actually covered 1500 miles between us.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.000
When I handed over the big cheque,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.760
they took me on a tour and it was amazing to see

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.080
there were so many people that had been saved

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.040
and it was really really special to see.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.320
Utility Aid buys and sells energy for the charity sector.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.560
It is an absolutely amazing space to operate in

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.080
because every single day we help charities save money.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.600
Utility Aid is a great place to work

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.760
because we’re a caring company in a caring sector

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.680
and those who can bring that caring nature to us,

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.960
they are just going to excel.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.040
We’ve also done a Steptober

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.520
which was doing as many steps as possible for the whole of October.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.560
It didn’t matter if you were a strong walker,

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.520
a weak walker, it was a team effort.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.680
We get two days paid leave a year to go and volunteer.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.240
Everybody really really cares.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.120
We did waitressing for 150 senior
citizens for their Christmas party.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.400
We found out that a lot of them are really lonely.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.320
They see everybody with people who are from their village.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.320
When they go back home,

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.280
they have got somebody that they can talk to.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.760
It was really really special.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.200
One of the best parts of my job is getting to call customers up

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.480
and telling them that  they’ve saved a lot of money.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.040
One time we called a women’s refuge

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.440
and told them they’d saved thousands and thousands of pounds.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.520
They were over the moon.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.640
I’ve never worked for anywhere so special.
