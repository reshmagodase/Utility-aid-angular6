1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,720
I love all the volunteer events.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,480
I love all the fundraisers that we do.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,120
I think that people should come and work for Utility Aid

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,760
because we really do care.

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,320
You get to speak to a lot of charities,

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,960
a lot of people who really need the help.

7
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,760
We all want to do things. It’s a big team.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,280
We took part in Red August for a mental health charity.

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,400
We ran every day.

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,200
We actually covered 1500 miles between us.

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,000
When I handed over the big cheque,

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,760
they took me on a tour and it was amazing to see

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,080
there were so many people that had been saved

14
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,040
and it was really really special to see.

15
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,320
Utility Aid buys and sells energy for the charity sector.

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,560
It is an absolutely amazing space to operate in

17
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,080
because every single day we help charities save money.

18
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,600
Utility Aid is a great place to work

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,760
because we’re a caring company in a caring sector

20
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,680
and those who can bring that caring nature to us,

21
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,960
they are just going to excel.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,040
We’ve also done a Steptober

23
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,520
which was doing as many steps as possible for the whole of October.

24
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,560
It didn’t matter if you were a strong walker,

25
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,520
a weak walker, it was a team effort.

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,680
We get two days paid leave a year to go and volunteer.

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,240
Everybody really really cares.

28
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,120
We did waitressing for 150 senior
citizens for their Christmas party.

29
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,400
We found out that a lot of them are really lonely.

30
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,320
They see everybody with people who are from their village.

31
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,320
When they go back home,

32
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,280
they have got somebody that they can talk to.

33
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,760
It was really really special.

34
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,200
One of the best parts of my job is getting to call customers up

35
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,480
and telling them that  they’ve saved a lot of money.

36
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,040
One time we called a women’s refuge

37
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,440
and told them they’d saved thousands and thousands of pounds.

38
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,520
They were over the moon.

39
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,640
I’ve never worked for anywhere so special.
