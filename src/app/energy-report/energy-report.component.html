            <p>What a year 2022 was! Prices were already riding high at the beginning of the year, then went stratospheric 
                during the summer as market nervousness about the potential for gas shortages over the winter went into 
                overdrive. It is well known that the root cause of the excessive prices has been Russia’s war on Ukraine and 
                the subsequent impact on gas supplies into Europe; however, a sole focus on this would be to miss a crucial 
                underlying trend which started a long time before the aggression escalated in Eastern Europe.</p><br>
               <p>What should we expect for 2023? In this update we look at the major risks and potential opportunities which
                will drive prices up or down over the next year. It seems unlikely that the conflict will be resolved any time
                soon – and equally uncertain whether gas would start flowing again even if it did. Elsewhere, economic growth
                can be expected from China as it relaxes its extreme COVID restrictions, which may lead to an increase in the
                price of oil and other general commodities. That said, as we head into the second half of the winter season,
                there is some cheer to be had from the performance of the gas and power systems in the past few months
                with no blackouts in spite of a period of extremely cold weather at the beginning of December.

            <p>The chart below shows the price history for the major energy commodities since the beginning of 2021, 
                showing the dramatic volatility and ever-increasing prices over the last year, peaking in August.

                <h1>OIL</h1>
            </div>
            <p style="color: #444444;">Oil has taken something of a back seat recently as its influence on gas prices has been heavily outweighed by the
                <img class="oilimg" src="assets/oil1.png" width="270" height="150" /> 
                Ukraine situation. It would be foolish to ignore it, though, since it will continue to be the long term fundamental
                driver of energy prices. There are two key things to look out for in the short term: the first being the new G7
                prices cap and refined product embargo on Russia. Analysts expect this to cause a reduction in the global supply of oil as Russia runs out
                of capacity to divert supplies to Asia. At the same time, a reviving
                Chinese economy is expected to drive prices up further. With OPEC already under-producing versus its quotas
                and a slow down in growth of US shale oil, the outlook for the crude price is distinctly bullish.

                <h1>GAS </h1>
            </div>
            <p style="color: black;">
                <img class="gasimg1" src="assets/gas.png" width="270" height="150" />
                Europe had allowed itself to become dependent on Russian gas. The question that has brewed since before the war is: To what extent 
                are we critically dependent upon it? The huge price spikes in August were a reflection of the real uncertainty about this – the key 
                question is to what degree that uncertainty has gone away. </p>
                 <p>The chart (below,right)shows where imports of gas have come from every month since the beginning of 2021.
                The red bars are imports from Russia – now dwindled to almost nothing. The blue bars are imports from Norway,
                which have remained fairly constant. There are two things that have made up the difference: (i) reduced overall 
                demand in response to mandatory and voluntary measures by industry, and (ii) a significant increase in Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) shipments.
            </p>
            <p>Whilst this is encouraging, and proves that we can survive entirely without Russian imports, it is important to
                note that LNG flows to the highest bidder. 
                <img class="gasimg2" src="assets/gas2.png" width="260" height="166" /> 
                Whilst we can be comfortable that physical security of supply will 
                be met, it comes at a price. Storage capacity is also increasing – Centrica has recommissioned the North Sea Rough storage facility in double-quick
                time. This is great news for day-to-day physical security, but also means higher demand for gas over the summer 
                (to fill it up). This combination suggests that overall prices are likely to be more stable, but will remain relatively high.

                <h1>ELECTRICITY</h1>
            </div>
            <p><img class="electricityimg" src="assets/electricity.png" width="300" height="168"/>
                Gas-fired electricity generation still makes up some 40% of the UK’s
                electricity production and continues to be the ‘marginal’ form of
                baseload generation, which means it sets the price for the market.
                As such, all the trauma of the gas market feeds directly into power
                prices, so they remain stubbornly linked. The industry has had its
                additional pressures, with the majority of the French nuclear fleet
                out of action until recently and carbon prices becoming almost as
                volatile as energy in recent times. On the positive side, the
                proportion of renewable generation continues to increase – and
                when the wind really picks up it becomes the highest single contributor!

            <h1>Non-Commodity Costs</h1>
            <p>Non-commodity costs (sometimes called ‘Non-Energy Costs’) are included in every bill and relate to things like the fixed costs of maintaining the physical electricity network (the National Grid Transmission System and local Distribution Network Operators)
                 as well as the costs of Environmental Charges to fund renewable subsidies and taxes.

            <h1>NON-COMMODITY COSTS OUTLOOK</h1>
            <p style="color: #444444;">The outlook for non-commodity costs is mixed. Although they don’t change with the same frequency as 
                wholesale gas and power prices, they are not immune to market forces. On the positive side, the exceptionally 
                high power prices we have seen means that generators supported by the ‘Contracts for Differences’ (CfD) 
                scheme will be paying back into the scheme instead of taking from it – filtering into bills from next April.
                Conversely, the high prices and volatility on wholesale markets mean that National Grid’s costs to balance the 
                electricity system have grown significantly. This means that BSUoS charges will continue to increase for at 
                least the next two years.
                Of more potential concern is the possibility that the government will seek to recoup the costs of its energy 
                price guarantee mechanisms this winter. The pink bands above give a conservative estimate of what impact 
                this might have – potentially adding 4p/kWh or more to everyone’s bills from 2023 or 2024.
